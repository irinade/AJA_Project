# AJA_Project : Reanalizing data and learning about reproductibility


Here you can find the code I worked on with 3 other fellow classmates.

The project was to reanalize data from a paper to see the difference with the results found in the paper and our results, to comment and have an insight on research reproductibility.

I will not add the dataframe that comes with the code because I do not own it and I don't know if I am allowed to share it publicly.
